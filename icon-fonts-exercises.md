### Research task

- How does a font icon work?
- What is the relationship between the HTML snippets you need to add? What is the job of each one?
- What could be happening behind the scenes for those HTML snippets to work?

## Done with icon fonts? Get practice with Git.

- Revisit [Git It](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron). In the beginning we skipped some parts, but it should all be making more sense to you now.
