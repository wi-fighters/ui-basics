# Create your own boilerplate

Make your way through the following checklist:
- Create a new public repo called 'website-boilerplate' using the above assignments as a starting point / inspiration (local + remote)


- Practice cloning the remote and using it as a starting point for a couple of different local projects (e.g create two separate sites based on it just to test)

- Make sure you have no nested repos (dir with a .git inside a dir with a .git. These show up with a directory icon in GitHub). Hint: Try the command `tree -L 2`and experiment with the arguments

- Invite a collaborator to make suggestions on your boilerplate (and they know about it) 

# Contribute to someone else's boilerplate

- Clone someone else's repo

- Checkout a new branch called 'suggestions'

- Make corrections and add something new.

- `git push origin suggestions` (NOT `git push`. NOT `git push origin master`)

- In GH open a pull request to merge suggestions into master

# Review suggestions on your own boilerplate

- Leave at least one comment to your collaborator

- Ask questions to your collaborator before discarding any suggestions (in GH or in person)

- Once the suggestions are considered, discussed and incorporated into master (whether you kept all/some/none of them), delete the incoming branch

- Reply to this thread with a link to your boilerplate repo
